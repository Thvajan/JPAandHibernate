Ways to write queries in JPA when required:
1. JPQL - Queries using Java entities
2. Criteria - using Java API
3. Native query directly


Using h2 for JDBC vs Spring JPA lesson:

App.prop
	spring.h2.console.enabled=true
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:<db_name>
Goto: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

Creating data.sql in resources folder

Spring JDBC reduces the no. of lines of code compared to nomal JDBC where we do everything manually (create a connection & statement, create query , map the resultset, close connection & statement and handle exception)


Junits:
@SpringBootTest(classes = JpaApplication.class)
@Test
@BeforeClass
@Before
@AfterClass
@After
@dirtiescontext(If the test method changes data in db, it will reset the changes done in the method)

JPA:
JPA allows ORMs to map tables and relations to java entities
In Entity Class:
	If table name is same as entity class name, @table is not required
	If column name is same as attribute field name, @column is not required
	No Args constructor required
	When using in memory DB Spring automatically triggers Schema update to create all defined entities
spring.jpa.showsql=true
get Entity Manager from @PersistantContext
entityManager.merge(Obj1) - does Save or Update
entityManager.persist(Obj1) - saves entity
entityManager.remove(Obj1) - does delete
entityManager.flush() - Sends all changes tracked by EM to DB
entityManager.detach(Obj1) - stops tracking changes done to this obj in this transaction
entityManager.clear()  - stops tracking changes done to all objs in this transaction
entityManager.refresh(Obj1)  
	- contents of Obj1 are refreshed(fetched from DB). hence any changes that are pending post the last flush will be lost 
	  and the obj1 is replaced with data current from DB
em.createQuery("Select c from Course c", Course.class) - Typed Queries
@NamedQueries(value = { @NamedQuery(name = "get_all_courses", query = "Select c from Course c"),
		@NamedQuery(name = "get_test_course", query = "Select c from Course c where c.name like '%JPA'") })
@OneToOne(mappedBy="variable name as in owning entity") - mappedBy is given in the non-owning side of the Bi-directional relationship
@onetoMany,ManytoMany fetch type is lazy by default
@manytoone,OneToOne fetch type is eager by default

To persist a One to many relationship between 2 entities: Ex: Course & Review
	1. Persist the One to many side entity. 
			Ex: em.persist(courseObj)
	2. For each many to one side entity, Assign One to many side entity inside it and Add it to the list in the One to many side entity.
			Ex: reviewObj1.setcourseObj; reviewObj2.setcourseObj; courseObj.setcourseObjtoList(reviewObjlist)
	3. Persist the One to many side entity. 
			Ex: em.persist(courseObj)

To persist a Many to many relationship between 2 entities: Ex: Student & Course
	1. Persist the individual entities. Ex: em.persist(studentObj) && em.persist(courseObj)
	2. Assign each entity inside the other. Ex: studentObj.setstudentObjtoList && courseObj.setcourseObjtoList
	3. Persist the owning side entity again. Ex. em.persist(studentObj) (assuming student entity owns the relationship i.e., mappedby is in course entoty class)
	
	
Hibernate:
@table - Used to map entity to table by name. Required If table and entity have different names
@column - Used to map entity attribute to table column by name. Required If table column and entity attribute have different names
@column(nullable = false)
@UpdateTimestamp
@CreationTimestamp

In a transaction, if em.flush() is called at a line, and an exception occurs and the transaction method end is not reached, hibernate will rollback all the flushed changes from the DB too.
